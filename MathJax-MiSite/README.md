# MathJax
This is a simple MiSite that demonstrates how to integrate MathJax with MiServer.
It was built based on a discussion in MiServer forum on the Dyalog forums webpage.

You'll need to download and install MathJax into the MathJax folder.

There are three MiPage's of interest
* index.mipage - show a simple way to integrate AsciiMath
* tex.mipage - show how to use a template (TeXPage) and widget (#.TeX) to simplify using TeX/LaTeX
* texform.mipage - show how to capture user input of TeX/LaTeX and return a rendered equation
